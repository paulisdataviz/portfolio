I am a Data Professional with 5+ years of experience applying Data and Business Analytics techniques to support decision-making and process improvement.

I’m currently working as a Data Visualization and Analytics consultant at CLEARTELLIGENCE.

I'm a Techie and lifelong learner. When I'm not working or enjoying time with my family, I like to spend time improving my skills and learning new tools or techniques.

I graduated as an Electronics' Engineer and have a M.S. in Telecommunications System Management. After spending several years working in Tech within the Telecom Industry, I discovered Data Analytics and became very passionate about Data Visualization and Data Wrangling.
